        Access Burst is the first burst a mobile transmits in order to establish a connection and it
        is used to estimate Timing Advance (TA) which is then applied to Normal Bursts to compensate
        for signal delay due to distance. So changing this setting effectively changes maximum range
        of the cell, because Access Bursts with a delay higher than this value will be ignored.

        USE FOR TESTING ONLY, DO NOT CHANGE IN PRODUCTION USE!
        During the normal operation, delay of Normal Bursts is controlled by the Timing Advance loop
        and thus Normal Bursts arrive to a BTS with no more than a couple GSM symbols, which is
        already taken into account in osmo-trx. Changing this setting will have no effect in
        production installations except increasing osmo-trx CPU load. This setting is only useful
        when testing with a transmitter which cannot precisely synchronize to the BTS downlink
        signal, like R&amp;S CMD57.
